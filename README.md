<h1> Miny code generator  </h1>

> Status: Developing ⚠️

### This project is a code generator, it is a very simple project for studies!

To create the project we use:

+ source code edit : VS code
+ Node.js : version: v18.18.1
+ Expo CLI Local
+ For more information see:https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/

## For this code to work in your project you need to install some libraries.

+ Slider: npx expo install @react-native-community/slider
A component that provides access to the system UI for a slider control, that allows users to pick among a range of values by dragging an anchor.

+ Clipboard: npx expo install expo-clipboard
expo-clipboard provides an interface for getting and setting Clipboard content on Android, iOS, and Web.

+ Async Storage: npx expo install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
is a React Native API used to store persistent data on the device. It is a way to save data in key and value format. Data saved with the AsyncStorage API is asynchronous, therefore it returns a Promise, and in case of an error it returns an Error. 

+ React Navigation: npm install @react-navigation/native.
React Navigation's native stack navigator provides a way for your app to transition between screens and manage navigation history. 

+ Installing dependencies into an Expo managed project: npx expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
This will install versions of these libraries that are compatible.

+ Bottom Tabs Navigator: npm install @react-navigation/bottom-tabs  
A simple tab bar on the bottom of the screen that lets you switch between different routes. Routes are lazily initialized -- their screen components are not mounted until they are first focused.
