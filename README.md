<h1> Miny code generator  </h1>

> Status: Developing ⚠️

### This project is a code generator, it is a very simple project for studies!

To create the project we use:

+ source code edit : VS code
+ Node.js : version: v18.18.1
+ Expo CLI Local
+ For more information see:https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/

## For this code to work in your project you need to install some libraries.

+ React Navigation: npm install @react-navigation/native-stack.
React Navigation's native stack navigator provides a way for your app to transition between screens and manage navigation history. 

+ Bottom Tabs Navigator: npm install @react-navigation/bottom-tabs  
A simple tab bar on the bottom of the screen that lets you switch between different routes. Routes are lazily initialized -- their screen components are not mounted until they are first focused.
